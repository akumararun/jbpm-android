# jbpm-android


jBPM is a flexible Business Process Management (BPM) Suite. It makes the bridge between business analysts and developers.
The jBPM can be accessed by a web based workbench. But the problem is that jBPM cannot be accessed by mobile users. Therefore
the idea of the project is to create a mobile UI of the jBPM-console where mobile users can interact some of the features of 
the jBPM-console. 
The jBPM core engine itself is a lightweight workflow engine. Therefore it can be run on android as well. Therefore apart 
from the mobile UI, a prototype of jBPM on android will be also created where user can interact withoutconnect to the 
jBPM-console.
